			<h4> The Internet </h4>
			<p>
				The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of HTML (hypertext markup language) that glues everything together via hyperlinks. A browser, such as google chrome, make requests via the internet, the world's largest comuter network, using http, the main protocall of the web, to servers, computers that host the files that make up the web.
			</p>
			<div>
				<em>HTML is the heart of the web.</em> It is made up of:
				<ul> 
					<li>text content (what you see).</li>
					<li>markup (what it looks like).</li>
					<li>references to other documents (such as images or links to other pages).</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h4> Tags </h4>
			<p>
				When coding, tags are used to tell the computer what to do. It is important that the code is accurate, because a computer can't do anything if there are any mistakes. Computers cannot assume what you <em>meant</em> to write.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tags tell the computer whether to make text bold or italicized, whether to put the text into a paragraph, and controls spacing in between the lines of text. A tag consists of a command, such at "div", within lesser-than and a greater-than symbols. Some tags are called void tags because they do not require a closing tag. One such example is the "img" tag, used for inserting an image. Alternate text is usually required when writing this tag in case someone is blind, or the image file does not exist anymore.
			</p>

			<h4> Cascading Style Sheets </h4>
			<p>
				Cascading style sheets, or CSS, determines the styling of the HTML. With CSS, you can change text fonts, backround colors, create bullet points, and set dimesions of your page's boxes. CSS is important in making your web page look pleasing to the user's eye.
			</p>
			<p>
				When using CSS, the code works similar to how a country's laws work. The national law applies to all people within those parameters. The state law applies to all people within that state, but not everyone in the country. A county law applies to everyone in that county, but not all the people within the state or country. But no matter what rules your county uses, everyoneone still has to follow the national rules. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The same idea applies to CSS code. A code can apply to everything within a parameter, and then there can be more specific code inside of those defined borders, but all code must still follow the most general rules.
			</p>
			<h4> Repetition </h4>
			<p>It is very important to refrain from repetition while coding. All code written should be as simple as possible, and all repeating elements can be explained to the computer program through CSS.
			</p>
		<h4>Box Positioning</h4>
			<div>
				When coding for a webpage, the coder will be given a design mock, a template for what the webpage should look like. With the design mock in sight, code, test, and refine, until your webpage looks just like the design mock. The steps to code for a design mock are:
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Get the structure down, using the red borders.</li>
					<li>Insert the needed tags (heading, ect.)</li>
					<li>Code the sizes of the boxes on your page</li>
					<li>Complete the layout of how you want the page to look</li>
					<li>Lastly, focus on the smaller details.</li>
				</ol>
